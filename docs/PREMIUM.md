# Premium: what is promised vs what is gated

Audited 2026-09-19, the week the second paying subscriber arrived. Every
surface that describes Premium was compared against the code that enforces
it, on both platforms. Keep this table true when either side changes.

| Promise | Web gate | iOS gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unlimited children (free: 3) | add-child-modal, `getChildLimit` | `childLimit` | gated both |
| Unlimited chores (free: 20, family-wide) | add-chore-modal, `getChoreLimit` | `choreLimit` | gated both (web since 2026-09-16) |
| Unlimited reward store items (free: 3) | server `wallet.ts` limits | `rewardItemLimit` + server | gated both |
| Unlimited goals (free: 1) | server `wallet.ts` limits | server | gated both |
| Premium themes (Ocean, Sunset, Forest, Aurora, Coral, Lavender) | appearance tab, `isPremiumTheme` + `canUseFeature` | `SeasonalTheme.isPremium` + `canUse(.themes)` | gated both, grandfathered |
| Family sharing / co-parent | family tab + `POST /api/family/invite` 403 | FamilySharingView owner section | gated both, grandfathered |
| Export reports (PDF, CSV) | downloads tab | feature does not exist on iOS | gated web, grandfathered |
| Advanced analytics / full insights | insights tab | Stats tab (HistoryView) | gated both, grandfathered |
| Priority email support | process, not code | | fine |

Copy that was false and is now fixed (2026-09-19): the homepage FAQ promised
a Premium trial (none exists: no Stripe `trial_period_days`, no Apple
introductory offer on either subscription); the iOS upgrade prompt listed
"Custom icons & categories" (never gated) and "Export reports" (no such
feature on iOS); the iOS paywall listed "Full insights & analytics"
(ungated). Both iOS screens now list only the gated set.

Bug fixed 2026-09-19: the Stripe webhook granted a tier only for
`mode=subscription`, so a Lifetime checkout ($149.99, one-time) would have
charged and granted nothing. `tierForCheckout()` in
`lib/utils/subscription.ts` is the tested decision now.

## Billing plumbing state

- Apple: proven live twice (2026-08-27 pre-token, healed; 2026-09-17 clean
  `SUBSCRIBED` -> premium with zero manual steps).
- Stripe: live key, webhook enabled for checkout.session.completed,
  customer.subscription.updated/deleted, invoice.payment_failed; prices
  live ($4.99 mo, $49.99 yr, $149.99 lifetime); all five env vars present
  in Vercel production. Never exercised: zero completed live checkouts
  ever (five abandoned sessions, last 2026-02-01). Code-reviewed, not
  battle-tested. A $0.50 self-purchase and refund would settle it.

## Decision (2026-09-19): gate to match the promise, grandfather everyone before

Rule, identical on both platforms (`canUseFeature` in
lib/utils/subscription.ts; `Entitlements.canUse` in Logic/Entitlements.swift):
a gated feature is available when the account is premium, **or** when the
account was created before `2026-09-19T00:00:00Z`. Every family that
existed before the cutoff keeps sharing, export, analytics, and the six
premium themes on the free plan. Every account created after it sees
Premium as advertised. Gates:

- Web: appearance tab locks the six themes (lock badge, click opens
  Billing); family tab hides Manage Sharing behind the gate and
  `POST /api/family/invite` returns 403; downloads tab disables PDF/CSV
  export (printable charts stay free); insights tab shows the gate instead
  of the dashboard. Android shell states the limit with no purchase CTA.
- iOS (rides 2.2.3): theme picker uses the same rule (existing free iOS
  families gain the six themes); Family Sharing's owner section and the
  Stats tab show `PremiumFeatureGate`, which opens the paywall.
- Co-parents inherit the owner's entitlement (web resolves the owner's
  profile via `family_settings.user_id`).
