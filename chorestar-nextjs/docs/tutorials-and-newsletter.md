### Tutorial 1: Adding Your First Child

**Getting Started: Add Your First Child to ChoreStar**

Ready to get your family set up? Adding a child to ChoreStar takes less than two minutes, and the fun part is picking their avatar.

Head to your family dashboard and tap **Add Child**. Enter your child's name and age, then here's where it gets fun — hit the **Randomize** button to generate a random robot avatar. Kids love seeing what they get! Don't like the first one? Keep hitting Randomize until something clicks. Once you've got a name and avatar, tap **Add Child** to save.

Now let's personalize it a bit. Find your child's card and tap **Edit**. Here you can:

- Choose a **background color** for their avatar card
- Pick a specific **robot style** if you want to swap from the randomized one
- Save your changes

That's it! Your child is officially in ChoreStar. Repeat this for each kid in your family — every child gets their own avatar, their own PIN, and their own little corner of the app.

### Tutorial 2: Creating a Morning Routine

**Set Up a Morning Routine in Minutes**

If mornings in your house feel like herding cats, ChoreStar's routines are about to become your new best friend. Here's how to get one going.

From your dashboard, tap the **Routines** tab, then hit **Add Routine**. You'll see a list of templates — go ahead and select **Morning Routine**. This template comes pre-loaded with six common steps like:

- Wake up
- Brush teeth
- Get dressed
- Make bed
- Eat breakfast
- Pack backpack

These are just starting points — you can add, remove, or rename steps to match your family's actual morning. Once you're happy with the list, tap **Create Routine**.

Your morning routine will now show up in the routines list, ready to assign to your kids. You can create a separate routine for each child if their mornings look different, or share one routine across the whole family. Bedtime works exactly the same way — just choose the **Bedtime Routine** template instead.

### Tutorial 3: Kid Login Setup

**Give Your Kids Their Own Login (No Email Required)**

One of ChoreStar's handiest features is the Kid Zone — a special login experience designed so kids can access their routines independently, without needing an email or password.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Tap the **Settings** gear icon
2. Go to the **Family** tab
3. You'll see your **Kid Login Link** — tap **Copy** to grab it

Now you need to give each child their own PIN:

1. Go back to your child's profile and tap **Edit**
2. Set a **4-digit PIN** they'll remember (birthdays, lucky numbers, whatever works)
3. Save

That's the whole setup. Share the link with your kid — bookmark it on the family tablet, text it to an older child's phone, or make it a shortcut on the home screen. When they visit the link and enter their PIN, they'll land directly in *your* family's ChoreStar, seeing only *their* routines. No one else's data, no confusing menus — just their stuff.

### Tutorial 4: Running a Routine (Kid's Perspective)

**What Your Kid Sees When They Log In**

Curious what the experience looks like on your child's end? Here's the full flow from their perspective.

Your kid visits the Kid Login Link (the one you shared from Settings). They'll see a simple PIN entry screen — no usernames, no passwords, just four taps. They enter their PIN and they're in.

Once logged in, they'll see their routine cards with a big, friendly **Start** button. They tap Start and the routine begins — one step at a time. Each step shows clearly on screen, and when they complete it, they tap to move to the next one. The interface is kept intentionally simple so even younger kids can navigate it solo.

When they finish the last step — cue the confetti! ChoreStar shows a **celebration screen** so kids get that satisfying "I did it!" moment. It's a small thing, but that little burst of positive reinforcement goes a long way toward building habits that actually stick.

### Tutorial 5: Family Settings & the Share Link

**Manage Your Family's ChoreStar Settings**

The Family Settings section is your command center for keeping everything organized. Here's a quick tour.

Tap the **Settings gear** icon from anywhere in the app, then select the **Family** tab. The first thing you'll see is your **Kid Login Link** — this is the unique URL that connects your family's ChoreStar account to the Kid Zone experience. Tap **Copy** to grab it anytime you need to re-share it.

From here you can also tap **Open Editor** to jump straight into managing your children's profiles. This is where you set or update each child's **4-digit PIN**. A few things worth knowing:

- Every child in your family gets their **own unique PIN**
- PINs are how ChoreStar tells kids apart at login
- You can update a PIN anytime if your child forgets it or you want to change it

Keep the Kid Login Link somewhere handy — a note on the fridge, a bookmark on the shared family device, or a text to your kids' phones all work great.

Hey ChoreStar families,

We've been busy — and we're so excited to share what's new. This update is packed with features designed to make family routines smoother, mornings less chaotic, and kids more independent. Here's everything that just dropped.

---

**Kids Can Now Log In on Their Own — No Email Needed**

Introducing the **Kid Zone**: a dedicated login experience built just for kids. Each family gets a unique Kid Login Link, and each child gets their own 4-digit PIN. Your kid visits the link, punches in their PIN, and lands directly in *their* view of ChoreStar — just their routines, front and center. No digging through menus, no accidentally seeing a sibling's stuff.

You'll find the link in **Settings → Family**. Set each child's PIN from their profile in the editor.

**Morning & Bedtime Routines with Built-In Templates**

Routines are here — and they come with templates so you're not starting from scratch. Choose the **Morning Routine** template and you'll get six ready-to-go steps (think: brush teeth, make bed, pack backpack). Choose **Bedtime Routine** for an evening wind-down checklist. Customize the steps, reorder them, add your own — it's totally flexible.

When your kid completes every step, they get a **celebration screen** as a reward. That little moment of "I did it!" makes a real difference for building lasting habits.

**Avatar Customization: Robots, Adventurers & More**

Every child deserves an avatar that feels like *theirs*. ChoreStar now offers **robot and adventurer avatar styles**, a selection of background colors, and a **Randomize button** that generates a new look instantly. Kids can land on something they love in seconds — or you can let them keep hitting Randomize just for the fun of it (we won't judge).

**Family Settings, Simplified**

Everything you need to manage your family's ChoreStar lives in one place. Head to **Settings → Family** to find your shareable Kid Login Link, jump into the editor to manage child profiles, and assign PINs — one per child, all in a few taps.

## Using GIFs in Email Newsletters

**How animated GIFs work in email**

Animated GIFs work natively in most modern email clients and newsletter platforms — Mailchimp, Beehiiv, and Substack all support them without any special configuration. You insert the GIF like a regular image, and it plays automatically for most subscribers. One important caveat: **Outlook on Windows (2013–2019) does not animate GIFs** — it shows only the first frame as a static image. Design with this in mind: make sure your first frame is visually clear and informative on its own.

**Target file size: under 1MB**

File size is the thing that trips most people up with GIFs in email. Aim to keep each GIF **under 1MB** — this ensures fast loading even on mobile. Up to **2MB is generally acceptable**, but expect slower loads. For product demo GIFs at typical email widths (600px), you can usually hit under 1MB by limiting the animation to 3–6 seconds and keeping the frame rate around 8–15fps. Tools like Ezgif, Gifski, or Squoosh can help compress without killing quality.

The GIFs this project generates are already at 720px/8fps which is close — if size is an issue, run them through Ezgif's "Optimize" tab and select "Reduce file size" to get them under 1MB.

**GIF vs. static image with a play button**

For highly polished or longer demos, consider using a **static thumbnail with a play button overlay**, linked to the hosted MP4 (or YouTube). This works in every email client, loads instantly, and drives click-through traffic. The tradeoff is an extra click. For short 2–4 second loops (like the avatar Randomize button), an inline GIF is usually the better choice — it delivers the "wow" immediately. For longer walkthroughs (like the full routine completion), a linked thumbnail wins.
