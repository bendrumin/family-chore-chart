# 📅 Week Calendar Grid View - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Complete!

We've successfully implemented a week calendar grid view matching the web app's functionality!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **WeekCalendarView.swift** - New View Component
A full-featured week calendar showing:
- **7-day grid** (Sunday through Saturday)
- **Chore rows** with icon, name, and category
- **Tappable cells** for each day/chore combination
- **Visual indicators** showing current day with a dot
- **Checkmarks** for completed cells
- **Empty state** when no chores exist

### 2. **SupabaseManager Updates**
Enhanced data tracking to support full week view:

```swift
@Published var weekCompletions: [(choreId: UUID, dayOfWeek: Int)] = []
```

#### New Methods:
- `isChoreCompleted(_ chore: Chore, forDay dayOfWeek: Int)` - Check completion for any day
- `toggleChoreCompletion(_ chore: Chore, forDay dayOfWeek: Int)` - Toggle any day
- `toggleChoreCompletion(_ chore: Chore)` - Convenience method for today (unchanged API)

#### Enhanced Data Loading:
- `loadCurrentDayCompletions()` now loads **all 7 days** of the current week
- Maintains both `choreCompletions` (today) and `weekCompletions` (full week)
- Automatically syncs when toggling any day

### 3. **Integration**
- **ChildDetailView** now has a calendar icon button in the toolbar
- Tapping opens WeekCalendarView as a modal sheet
- Includes confetti 🎉, sounds 🎵, and achievement alerts 🏆

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User opens a child's detail page
2. Taps the **calendar icon** in the toolbar
3. Sees a grid with:
   - Columns: Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
   - Rows: Each chore with its icon and name
   - Cells: Tap to toggle completion
4. Today's column has a **coral dot** indicator
5. Completed cells show a **green checkmark**
6. Tap any cell to toggle that chore for that day

### Data Synchronization
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately
- **Database sync**: Saves to Supabase `chore_completions` table
- **Full week tracking**: Loads all 7 days of current week
- **Real-time refresh**: Pull to refresh supported

## Visual Design

### Grid Layout
```
┌──────────────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│ Chore        │ Sun  │ Mon  │ Tue  │ Wed  │ Thu  │ Fri  │ Sat  │
├──────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
│ 🛏️ Make Bed  │  ✓   │  ✓   │  •   │      │      │      │      │
│ 🐕 Feed Dog  │  ✓   │      │  ✓   │      │      │      │      │
│ 🧹 Sweep     │      │  ✓   │      │      │      │      │      │
└──────────────┴──────┴────── ┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
                       ↑ Today (with dot indicator)
```

### Color Scheme
- **Completed cells**: Green background with white checkmark
- **Empty cells**: Light gray with subtle border
- **Today's column**: Coral border to highlight
- **Headers**: Bold text with current day highlighted

## Database Schema

Uses existing `chore_completions` table:
```sql
- chore_id: UUID (reference to chore)
- day_of_week: INTEGER (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- week_start: DATE (Sunday of the current week)
- completed_at: TIMESTAMP
```

**Unique constraint**: `(chore_id, day_of_week, week_start)`
- Prevents duplicate completions
- Allows same chore across different days/weeks
